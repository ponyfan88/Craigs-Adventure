                <p class="centered">Craig is the perfect Crazy Uncle. Hip clothes,
                    side burns, questionable intellect. He really has 
                    it all! Nobody knows how he ended up in
                    the land of Jauntlet, but he sure isn't
                    going to stick around to find out.</p>

                <p class="centered">The land of Jauntlet is a mysterious land
                    cursed with all sorts of magic. From
                    Goblins to wizards and slimes, anything
                    could happen in the land of Jauntlet.</p>

                <p class="centered">Craig is not unarmed during his journey.
                    Craig always carries around his trusty
                    sword in case of flying squirrels, and it's
                    paid off cause not only can he deal damage
                    close range, but also get away quickly
                    with his dash.</p>

                <h1 class="centered">Your Tools</h1>
                <p class="centered">Unkept dungeons are always filled with junk 
                    sitting in every corner. Thankfully Craig is very 
                    resourceful as he will gladly pick up strange 
                    statues and ominous  runes as to throw them 
                    at the nearest moving object. Watch for 
                    bombs and heart containers as they will
                    show themselves very useful.</p>
